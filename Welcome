PAC Admin Menu is a structured and actively maintained administrative tool built for FiveM servers. This project is designed not just to provide functionality, but to help users learn, understand, and properly manage administrative systems within their server environment.

By using the PAC Admin Menu, you’ll gain insight into how admin tools are structured, how permissions and features are handled, and best practices for maintaining stability and fairness on a FiveM server. The project is actively maintained, with updates, fixes, and improvements provided as needed.

Support and guidance are a core part of this project. Questions, issues, and feature discussions are welcomed, and users can expect clear guidance and explanations to help them use and customize the menu effectively. Whether you’re new to server administration or looking to refine your workflow, PAC Admin Menu aims to be both a reliable tool and a learning resource.
